This is my personal site/blog, the stack uses some of the following technologies:

### Templates

* Markdown for text-based content
* JSON and YAML for structured data
* Nunjucks as a templating engine

### Style

* Sass as a CSS processor
* Vanilla CSS for all styles

### Build tools

* 11ty as a static site generator
* Gulp to handle assets like styles and fonts
